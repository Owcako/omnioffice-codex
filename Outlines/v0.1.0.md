# UI

    Vertical white-gray container taking up the entire height on the left of the screen with shadows on its right edge
        Button on the container with text "Proofread"

    Textbox in the center taking up the whole screen that is left with no outlines (feels like background) allowing user to input text with placeholder "Start writing your masterpiece"

    Vertical white-gray panel on the right side of the screen taking up the entire height

# Logic

    When user clicks "Proofread" button on the container, send the whole text in the textbox to Gemini (processing logic will be provided, label "# Template" in the boilerplate part of the service for now) and return a list of grammar, clarity, and readability issues in the text.

# UI Response to Logic

    Display the list of text issues, each as a white card with shadows on its left and bottom edge, stacked in the vertical panel on the right.

    Each card contains
        Small gray note on the top left corner with category of issue (category is not selectable, it is "random" text written by AI)
        Big heading on the center with text "Original word/sentence -> **Fixed word/sentence**"
        A sentence on the bottom of heading with a short note about the original's weakness and the fixed's corrections
