# UI

    Vertical `gray.50`-colored container taking up the entire height on the left of the screen with shadows on its right edge
        Button on the container with text "Proofread"

    Textbox in the center taking up the whole screen that is left with no outlines and a transparent background, allowing user to input text with a `gray.200` placeholder text "Start writing your masterpiece" (placeholder means it disappears when the user typed something)

    Vertical `gray.50`-colored panel on the right side of the screen taking up the entire height

# Logic

    When user clicks "Proofread" button on the container, send the whole text in the textbox to Gemini (processing logic will be provided, label "# Template" in the boilerplate part of the service for now) and return a list of grammar, clarity, and readability issues in the text.

    When user clicks "Accept" button on a card, find the first string that matches the `Original word/sentence` on the card in the textbox, replace it with the exact `Fixed word/sentence` without additional formatting, and remove the card from the panel. The matching should not be case-sensitive, but it should match exact spelling/punctuation.

    When user clicks "Dismiss" button on a card, remove that card from the vertical panel on the right.

# UI Response to Logic

    Display the list of text issues, each as a white card with shadows on its left and bottom edge, stacked in the vertical panel on the right.

    Each card contains
        Small gray note on the top left corner with category of issue (category is not an enum, it is written by AI)
        Big heading on the center with text "Original word/sentence -> **Fixed word/sentence**"
        A sentence or two on the bottom of heading with a short note about the original's weaknesses and the fix's strengths.
        Two buttons on the bottom left corner of card, "Accept" and "Dismiss".
